# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project detects driver drowsiness in real-time using OpenCV, Haar Cascade Classifiers, and a trained CNN model. It triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected.

## Features
- Real-time face and eye detection
- Drowsiness alert system
- Uses pre-trained Haar cascades and a custom CNN model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Haar cascades
